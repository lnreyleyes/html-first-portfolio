<h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<p>From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime dynasties that came 
    after The Godfather are descendants of the Corleones: Francis Ford Coppola’s 
    magnum opus is the ultimate patriarch of the Mafia genre. A monumental opening 
    line (“I believe in America”) sets the operatic Mario Puzo adaptation in motion, 
    before Coppola’s epic morphs into a chilling dismantling of the American dream. 
    The corruption-soaked story follows a powerful immigrant family grappling with the 
    paradoxical values of reign and religion; those moral contradictions are crystallized 
    in a legendary baptism sequence, superbly edited in parallel to the murdering of 
    four rivaling dons. With countless iconic details—a horse’s severed head, Marlon 
    Brando’s wheezy voice, Nino Rota’s catchy waltz—The Godfather’s authority lives on.</p>

<h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
<p> There’s a new Batman in Gotham, in the shadowy form of Matt Reeves’s The 
    Batman – and this is the bar it has to clear. The middle entry in Christopher 
    Nolan’s Bat-trilogy is an almost flawless case study of how to do a sophisticated 
    superhero epic for modern audiences – and the ‘almost’ is only because the final 
    act refreshingly tries to cram in almost too many ideas, much moral arithmetic. 
    Heath Ledger’s Joker, meanwhile, redefines big-screen villainy: It’s not enough to 
    be sinister, you need a party trick now too.</p>

<h3>The Truman Show (1998)</h3>
<p> The late ’90s spawned two prescient satires of reality TV, back when it was still in 
    its pre-epidemic phase: the underrated EDtv and, this, Peter Weir’s profound 
    statement on the way the media has its claws in us. In some ways a kinder, gentler 
    version of Network, The Truman Show is a TV parable in which a meek hero (Jim 
    Carrey) wins back his life. It can also be considered an angrier film, slamming both 
    the controlling TV networks (represented by Ed Harris’s messiahlike Christof) and 
    us, the viewing public, for making a game show of other people’s lives. </p>
